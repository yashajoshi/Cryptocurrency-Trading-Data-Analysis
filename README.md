# Cryptocurrency-Trading-Data-Analysis
## 1. Motivation:
- Cryptocurrency is a new type of currency circulating in the market. With Bitcoin invented in 2009, now there emerges over 2,000 types of cryptocurrencies and has a total market value more than 110 billion [https://coinmarketcap.com]. The price movement is exciting like roller coaster, but people really don't know much about this virtual asset.
- In this project, I am analyzing the historical cryptocurrency trading dataset, to portrait its dynamic landscape and dig into features of crypto currencies to figure out if any patterns in their price movement.
## 2. Research Questions:
- How is the market of cryptocurrency emerging? Which currency has a leading position in the market? Do they survive or die over time?
- Explore the statistical characteristics of daily log return, how can we model it with distribution? Are different currencies show similar pattern?
- Cryptocurrency are virtual assets, do they have correlation with real world financial assets, e.g. USD, Gold price, stock indices. Can we use regression models to explain the dynamics of Crypto by real world financial assets?
- What is the best currency to buy? Use machine learning techniques to select currencies with best performance.
